# Igli's Unix Mission

### Finding the diamonds

To find the diamonds, I used the command ``grep -Rw ~/cs1998-mission/ -e 'diamond'``.
Where the ``-R`` option tells **grep** to read all files under each directory recursively, and the **-w** option instructs it to only select lines containing matches. The ``-e`` option is used to specify the string to be searched, in this case 'diamond'.

### Deleting all the bags that do not contain diamonds

### Deleting the directories on the paths that do not lead to diamonds
